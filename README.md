# Welcome to my submission for Saatva's hiring test!

## Getting Started

- Download the compressed file which contains my project or clone(fork/clone) the repo.

  - Save the project in a place where you can easily access it. I recommend your Desktop.

- Open the project in your terminal or other IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
     
- Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or IDE terminal.
    - In VSCode you can open the project, click terminal in the top menu bar and then click new terminal. It should directly bring you to the project folder but in case, you should see saatva-hiring-test as the final path.  

- Once in the project folder run the following commands in your terminal:
  - NOTE: This requires node.js to be installed. 

  - npm install
  - npm start

- Your localhost should open and you should now be able to access my project in development mode!
