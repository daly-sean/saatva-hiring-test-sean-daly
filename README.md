# Welcome to my submission for Saatva's hiring test!

## Getting Started

- Download the compressed file which contains my project.

  - Save the project in a place where you can easily access it. I recommend your Desktop.

- Open the project in your terminal or other IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
     
- Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or IDE terminal.
    - In VSCode you can open the project, click terminal in the top menu bar and then click new terminal.

- Once in the project folder run the following commands in your terminal:
  - NOTE: This requires node.js to be installed. 

  - npm install
  - npm start

- Your localhost should open and you should now be able to access my project in development mode!
